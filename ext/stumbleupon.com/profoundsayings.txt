in a world of failed hopes and staggered dreams,
we keep on going because there is nothing else left to do
 
advice, propositions, all encapsulating words,
to guide the soul and fire the mind.
but meaningless without the knowledge,
that truth and experience lies behind voice
 
so in this world of attempted definition,
when sometimes voice gets drowned by reality noise,

to listen to his own advice.

A figure walks slowly out of the narrow opening, his head down, a traveller.


The traveller hobbled slowly over to a smooth rock just outside town, its grey surface warmed by the sun.

Creases around his eyes bunch like ripples on water.
"All roads lead to paradox my friend, do not travel this road today."

If you wish to see the road I have walked, take your love to the highest hill in the park and lie on the grass in the sun with her, looking out over it's majesty. You will see more than I have in all my years."

"Concerning all acts of initiative and creation there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: That the moment one definitely commits oneself then providence moves too. All sorts of things occur that would never otherwise have occurred.

"A human being is a part of a whole, called by us 'universe', a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.

Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty." (Albert Einstein)

"Today I was surrounded by children. Unlike the parents that were with them, looking over them and out for them, the children were, by and large, fearless. They took pleasure from each moment, infusing joy into the very air around us. Once again I found myself asking inner questions. When did I lose that essential, happy quality that children share? At what point did fear enter and begin to consume my time? Pondering this, I had the realization that it happens each day, at a certain point after waking. I resolved then and there to postpone the moment of surrender to my fear as long as possible, each day, until I find a way to postpone it forever." (JE)

"No-one can reveal something to you that isn't already deep within you. All that any of us lack is a clear understanding of what's within. For countless ages, mankind has been looking for The Answer in a package that shrieks of separateness, but this only contributes to our overwhelming sense of aloneness, and that is what we fear the most. If we really want to understand the invisible pattern being woven by the strands of the Force around us, first we must learn to go within. There is no higher calling, since that is where the Master lives -- not in some Council chamber." (JE)

"I overheard an interesting conversation the other day... someone was remarking that if the Force is something that 'midichlorians' know and converse with, then maybe it's even smaller than microscopic. Perhaps it's subatomic. Or maybe it's a feature of the macrocosm-- that super-universal reality so vast it makes us mere humans seem like atoms in the bloodstream of a gnat on the ass of a dog that belongs to a god. Perhaps we're all really subatomic particles living inside a fishbowl on Obi-Wan's coffee table. Or maybe it's ...
I walked away from that conversation laughing, because they missed the whole point. Size and weight are (relatively) useless bits of knowledge that bring us no closer to hearing the will of the Force.

Relinquish all attachment to the result. (Bhagavad Gita)

###########################

Instead of asking for help when you are overwhelmed by the power of the experience, demand your own power.  Call for it, don’t ask for it, it’s yours.  Take it back, it’s yours.  It’s an attitude thing in part.  Instead of “I feel overwhelmed and fearful, please help me”, (and this works, you usually do get help)  Take an attitude of “Oh, yeaah! Bring it on!”  Sort of doing Aikido on yourself, instead of fighting against the experience, you start trying to go move faster in the direction of the current.  When you catch up to the rate the water is moving, you are almost at rest within it.  Course, that doesn’t mean your not going to try and stand up to declare your new control, and fall on your face because you’re too stoned to walk.

"We have shame when we persistently feel that we are not acceptable, maybe unworthy, and are less than the good person we are supposed to be. Shame is a vague, undefined heaviness that presses on our spirit, dampens our gratitude for the goodness of life, and slackens the free flow of joy.

"To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to leave the world a little better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.

"There are many who find a good alibi far more attractive than an achievement. For an achievement does not settle anything permanently. We still have to prove our worth anew each day: we have to prove that we are as good today as we were yesterday. But when we have a valid alibi for not achieving anything we are fixed, so to speak, for life. Moreover, when we have an alibi for not writing a book, painting a picture, and so on, we have an alibi for not writing the greatest book and not painting the greatest picture. Small wonder that the effort expended and the punishment endured in obtaining a good alibi often exceed the effort and grief requisite for the attainment of a most marked achievement."

Man is conceited, self-centered and self-absorbed. He is of the opinion that the sun, the moon, the stars, they were created for his liking and for his admiration. He feels that his emotions matter above that of everyone else; it is his way or no way. Coming into this world with nothing more than a slimey coat, he feels that he has the right to a happy life, free from and far above the turmoil that plagues all in the land of the living. As if he himself is not alive.
