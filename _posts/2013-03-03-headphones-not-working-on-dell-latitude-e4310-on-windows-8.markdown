Spontaneously stopped producing sound when plugged in. Were still being recognized as being connected but totally silent.  
  
Downloaded and installed this [IDT driver](http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriverDetails?driverId=R278544 "IDT driver") from Dell and they immediately started working without reboot.
