Struggled with manual strongswan, struggled with Sophos essential UTM.  
  
Someone make a simple to setup and use secure VPN hub that lets people connect to an Amazon EC2 instance or other linux box, connect to it's shares and the shares of other connected devices as if it was on a LAN and route Internet traffic out from that point too.  
  
I'll buy a stripped down Astaro/Sophos UTM (that uses standard IPSEC packages under the covers) with nice web interface that accomplishes the above.
