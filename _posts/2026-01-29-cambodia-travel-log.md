Travel here not as hard work as expected. Singapore Air flights were comfortable and the 12+ hour flight to Singapore went surprisingly quickly. Food was particularly tasty. Entertainment system worked with the airline adapter cable provided by my Sennheiser headphones. Noise cancelling made the audio for media easy to hear without boosting the volume. No discernible impact on 🦻T.

M and C very welcoming hosts. They have a big house with a pool. 3 ginger cats called John Cena, John Malkovich (Meowkovich?), and Captain Nibbles the Third.

Little excursion to a bar last night, C and I excused ourselves relatively early and I settled in for a big jet-lag sleep until 11:00 this morning.

Noodles and some marmite on toast (brought on request) for brekkie. Coffee via 'Grab' (like Uber+Uber Eats combined).

We went for a sauna and swim on the scooter before work for $4.50. The roads are 'exciting' but not crazy busy.

It's sunny and warm here. I'm sitting on my bed with fan on and the shutters open doing some work. I can hear bird tweeting outside and a cockerel just doodle-do'd! My mood has improved enormously.

M & C went to a birthday early evening while I was working. There is quite a big ex-pat community that they are friends with. Tied to drinking culture, although there is gym, golf, bouldering etc that brings people together. They host poker and board games at their house.

We had a swim in the pool and hung out when they got back. Everyone packed up around midnight. I didn't sleep super well, possibly due to the different ADHD meds I'm taking here. I was concerned about bringing potentially controlled items across a border - it was difficult to work out what was ok or not. Anyway, nothing a good few laps of the pool won't sort out.

Ordered some breakfast on the local Grab app. Apparently everything comes with rice so we might have a bit of a surplus! Ordered 6 items (some for lunch while I'm working - £11.50 including delivery). Would probably be pushing £40 in the UK.

I'm being a conscientious, clean, and tidy house guest. I'm hoping to visit the shops with them today/tomorrow to pick up some essentials like bread (apparently the bread is good due to French colonial influences) and other bits so we're not ordering every day.

Am quite content to just work and rest. Much the same as the UK but warm and bright out. The work day did get a little tricky finishing at ~2100-2200 but I suspect a good portion of that was jet lag. I didn't really need to wake up so early, and in fact would probably fall back to my normal UK mode of 10AM starts alarms, if I wasn't with company.

--Resumed ~15:00

We drove motorcycles to the city to get some coffee, have a walk, and do some shopping. I'm not insured for driving even a scooter since I don't hold a full license, but the speeds are low enough I accepted the risk. The roads are somewhat chaotic, but ultimately relatively chill. The only dangerous person I saw was a white guy pulling out of a bar in front of someone.

We got coffees (and a lychee tea for myself) at a clean air-conditioned place. Then I went with C to a newly opened shopping place that might as well have been Marks and Spencer. Eggs, bread, and some cheeky Korean chocolate ice cream later, C took a tuk tuk back with the shopping and I rode home.

Time for work. I'm going to hopefully sleep well this evening - fading a little and it's only the 'start' of the work day at 3PM.
