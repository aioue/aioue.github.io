Travel here not as hard work as expected. Singapore Air flights were comfortable and the 12+ hour flight to Singapore went surprisingly quickly. Food was particularly tasty. Entertainment system worked with the airline adapter cable provided by my Sennheiser headphones. Noise cancelling made the audio for media easy to hear without boosting the volume. No discernible impact on 🦻T.

M and C very welcoming hosts. They have a big house with a pool. 3 ginger cats called John Cena, John Malkovich (Meowkovich?), and Captain Nibbles the Third.

Little excursion to a bar last night, C and I excused ourselves relatively early and I settled in for a big jet-lag sleep until 11:00 this morning.

Noodles and some marmite on toast (brought on request) for brekkie. Coffee via 'Grab' (like Uber+Uber Eats combined).

We went for a sauna and swim on the scooter before work for $4.50. The roads are 'exciting' but not crazy busy.

It's sunny and warm here. I'm sitting on my bed with fan on and the shutters open doing some work. I can hear bird tweeting outside and a cockerel just doodle-do'd! My mood has improved enormously.
